Dear Amazing .Net/Angular Developer,
This is sample application which demonstrates a new possibility of sharing the WebAPI structure to the frontend world and 
have an organised service layer at Angular app to receive and implement service class to be used inside the angular application.
This method of servicing gives the developers a neat and clear visibility of possible functionalities on server side.
I never felt blindness about the remote side possibilities after adding this feature to my angular app.
I hope you enjoy using Sheer.API and hope to receive your feedback which is highly appreciated by me.
Sincerely Yours.
Ryan Tavan.
